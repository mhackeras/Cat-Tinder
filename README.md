Hi Mindera team.

Here is the challenge completed.

Wrote some tests but didn't have the time to write even more and add more coverage.

Also if I had some more time I would do some improvements and I would split swiper to a separate component (Didn't do because needed ref forwarding and ran out of time).

Also api was some how complicated so I didn't achieve to fetch cat's info. 
Now it's just displaying the id. 

Using image endpoint just returned info for the image. Probably needed to use the image_id to fetch the extra info but ran out of time mostly.
